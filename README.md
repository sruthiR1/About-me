# About-me
I have a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology from Rutgers University, with minors in Critical Intelligence and Digital Media and Communications. I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and creating tools and experiences that make life easier and more efficient for people.

I have hands-on experience with coding, app development, web design, and projects in areas including cybersecurity, data analysis, and user experience. My technical skill set includes Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and I’ve worked with tools and frameworks like Flask, React, pandas, Tableau, and GitHub. I also have a strong foundation in UI/UX design and graphic design, allowing me to create products that are both functional and visually appealing.

I enjoy collaborating with others, and my strengths include communication, problem-solving, teamwork, and leadership in group settings. I thrive in environments where I can combine technical expertise with creative thinking to build impactful solutions.
